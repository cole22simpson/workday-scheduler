## What it does

This scheduler helps you keep track of your daily tasks. There is a time block for each hour of the workday (9-5). At the click of your mouse, you can edit each time blocks to leave yourself helpful reminders. Another helpful feature is that each time block will show a certain color based on what time has passed and what is in the future.

## Issues I ran into

This remains a persiting problem that I need to look more into, but figuring out how to put my data in localStorage has proven challenging.
